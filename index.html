	  <h1>Career Plans</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Nicholas: Financial Advisor
		<br></br>
		The career path for Nicholas has not changed since assignment 1 and 2.
		<br></br>
		Ahmed: Software Engineer
		<br></br>
		The career path for Ahmed has not changed since assignment 1 and 2.
		<br></br>
		A comparison between these two jobs is as follows:
		<br></br>
		A financial advisor specializes in giving credible financial advice to a client in various areas, for example; Superannuation towards retirement. They help the client set specific financial plans outlined in what the desired goals and outcomes of a client is to help achieve those goals or realign the goals to be more reasonable by putting in place certain strategies for the outcomes.

		<br></br>

		A software engineer specializes in the design and creation of computer systems and applications to achieve an outcome to solve problems. By putting forward their knowledge in various areas of programming and development they strive to create solutions to real world problems given to them by their clients, employers, or their own curiosity a very hands-on, deep-thinking role.

		<br></br>

		The similarities between the two careers listed are the fact that they both must solve real-world problems for someone by applying their expertise in an area to create a finished product to help with everyday life/financial life. They both use problem solving skills and strategies to form the basis of their profession.

		<br></br>

		The differences between these positions are that the field they specialize in has some crossover in terms of using computer programs, but the fields of finance and software engineering are not exactly overlapping. Software engineers do at times involve themselves with some form of financial knowledge for a budget of a product but not the strategic length or plan in the future as they focus on development for products.

		<br></br>

		The career paths themselves are similar in terms of needing to achieve an education to end up at their desired goals and using this knowledge of problem solving to get the end, however they both take different routes from that point, to a more information technology focused route from a financial focused route.
