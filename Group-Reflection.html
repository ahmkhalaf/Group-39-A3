	<h2>Nicholas:</h2>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Reflecting on the group's performance this time around is different, we first started assignment 2 with 6 members, it was diminished to 4 members and the participation factor with those members was zero or very minimal. In assignment 3, Ahmed and myself were very communicative at the start and while waiting for Kai and Amy to respond, we find out Kai has left the group and Amy is still missing in action. To say this project has been a success would be extremely far from the truth compared to the knowledge learnt during the course and the standard required to get a good result. We took up the roles of addressing a group leader and setting out who was to do what and where and even with this implementation, we still cannot form a functioning group and I am disappointed things could not turn out better. </h5>

	<h2>Ahmed:</h2>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">This group has been in shambles since day 1! Maybe it was because we were auto assigned or maybe because we don’t have chemistry together, but unfortunately for this group nothing really went well. As you can see this group has been reduced from 7-6 people all the way down to 2 people, so to say that this group is/was doing well would be atrocious, I know that group work is supposed to teach us how it is to work with people when in a job but looking at this group it could make anyone scared to participate in group work which is not the objective. There are obviously many improvements that could be made, but I think the main ones would be communication and responsibilities. Communication is the only way a group can work together and without it everything fails, nothing will ever work out if there isn’t good communication and without good communication comes the lack of responsibility. This team could have worked out if each team member felt responsible for something, but unfortunately that didn’t happen. I can’t really comment much on the GitHub activity ad this is 2-man mission and when it comes to activity it will be close to nothing cause of how it is only the 2 of us now.</h5>
