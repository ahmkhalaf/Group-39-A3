	  <h3>Details about what the project will do</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The project will attempt to create a proof of concept based on the design features of a search engine with a database. The database process of retrieving information is as follows: When a query is initiated, searching for occurrence of (‘Stranger Things’ as an example) as they are found, the results are then displayed on the website. This will then show the user the results and recommendations related to the initial query, along with details of the piece of media, a link to take you to the streaming platforms information page of the media and an additional link to sign up to the stream platform if you wish to view it. The project will also have a final report attached to it based on the criteria of this assignment. </h5>

	  <h3>How we will get it done</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The group work for the project will be divided into four sections, Ahmed, Amy, Kai, and Nicholas (amendment; group now down to Ahmed and Nicholas), Ahmed will focus on the GitHub portion of the assignment by relaying the information of the PDF report created by Nicholas, the formation of the proof of concept artefact will be done in GitHub with the possible addition of using search engine programs which will be listed in the tools and technology section of this report.<br></br>The group will function within Microsoft Teams and have a direct open dialogue with each other with emails and direct messaging on Microsoft teams in addition to meetings and an open document to implement any changes.  </h5>

	  <h3>Include how far development of features and outcomes have progressed</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Creation and development of features within the program, have not escaped the scope as time restraints and departure of members has led to a focused and narrow area in what could be developed, the search functionality and database creation to show the proof of concept is on track to be completed. If more time were allocated looking for multiple weeks down the track in the future and with more funding for employees in addition to the group members, additional features could have been added, unfortunately that is not the case for this current project. </h5>

	  <h3>How the project started journey from assignment 1 to 2 to actualized in 3</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This project’s journey began with Nicholas’ original assignment 1, as an application to search out specific pieces of media and give you directions to that query raised and lead the user to the destination on a specific platform.<br></br>In assignment 2, the project had slightly differed in terms of turning an application into a website instead, leaving it to be modified by multiple peoples input and losing some of that functionality of an application but gaining the foundation of a website instead. <br></br>Assignment 3, the project has differed once again. Using a website for the basis and creating a database in which the query can be pulled from and produce recommendations of other kinds of media related to the initial query into a sign-up page to the platform. <br></br>As stated, the journey for this project has evolved and changed over the period of twelve weeks, from a more boarder product to a more defined product the scope creep that could of appear has been trimmed back to the basics of the project. </h5>

	  <h3>What stage we finished on refers to timeline. </h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The timeline provided in the timeframe section will lay out what has occurred during the project for more information</h5>

	  <h3>Include dead ends (scope creep)</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">As stated earlier in this report, additions to the project could have been made, however with the diminished work force anything additional was scraped before it was started on, however ideas of cross-platform, different forms of interconnectivity, additional quality assurance and a large array of recommendations could have happened if not for the limitations of the group. </h5>

	  <h3>Product stages as a whole</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Beginning the project, the decision to continue with a modified version of Nicholas’ project idea was accepted and work then began, report writing was left to Nicholas and realizing the group work was left to Ahmed in GitHub.<br></br>Steps that are taken to complete the project</h5>

	  <ul>
		<li>Conduct a suitable amount of research into the field to produce a product with commercial viability </li>
		<li>Define the scope of the produce and stick to the boundaries contained within said scope for the duration of the project </li>
