Team Profile  

Team Name 

404 internet explorers (Group 39) 

  

Personal Information 

Name: Nicholas Kyriakakis 

Interests: Interested in Finance and in relation to how IT (Information Technology) can be efficient in smoothing those systems 

Student number: s3814684  

Background: Australian, Greek background with the ability to speak English and a beginner’s level of Japanese and Chinese. 

IT Experience: A small amount of IT experience from an early age during primary school programs and a father who specializes in It, however outside of that personally zero experience, hoping that this course will shed some needed light on the topic and give ways to learn new skillsets. 

  

Name: Ahmed Khalaf 

Interests: Interested in the field of software engineering  

Student number: s3967496 

Background: Born and raised in Saudi Arabia, but from Palestine, then moved to New Zealand and currently reside in Australia with the ability to speak Arabic and English. 

IT Experience: includes learning to program from an early age using the language Scratch, primary focus on coding and creating programs from the ground up. I proceeded to learn later in life a wide array of programming languages during computer science courses such as; Python, HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Java and SWL databases. Also use to using a 3D (3 Dimensional) Printer to create a robotic body. 

  

Group Processes 

The group itself did not function as a group for assignment 2, with lack of communication between group members, no meetings recorded, and general slackness. 

Changes towards assignment 3; Promoting a group leader to guide everyone in what tasks need to be outlined, more direct communication on Microsoft teams, holding team meetings to understand where people are in reference to the planned outcome and to have an open dialogue between members.  

  

  

  

Career Plans 

Nicholas: Financial Advisor  

The career path for Nicholas has not changed since assignment 1 and 2. 

Ahmed: Software Engineer  

The career path for Ahmed has not changed since assignment 1 and 2. 

A comparison between these two jobs is as follows: 

A financial advisor specializes in giving credible financial advice to a client in various areas, for example; Superannuation towards retirement. They help the client set specific financial plans outlined in what the desired goals and outcomes of a client is to help achieve those goals or realign the goals to be more reasonable by putting in place certain strategies for the outcomes. 

  

A software engineer specializes in the design and creation of computer systems and applications to achieve an outcome to solve problems. By putting forward their knowledge in various areas of programming and development they strive to create solutions to real world problems given to them by their clients, employers, or their own curiosity a very hands-on, deep-thinking role.  

  

The similarities between the two careers listed are the fact that they both must solve real-world problems for someone by applying their expertise in an area to create a finished product to help with everyday life/financial life. They both use problem solving skills and strategies to form the basis of their profession.  

  

The differences between these positions are that the field they specialize in has some crossover in terms of using computer programs, but the fields of finance and software engineering are not exactly overlapping. Software engineers do at times involve themselves with some form of financial knowledge for a budget of a product but not the strategic length or plan in the future as they focus on development for products.  

  

The career paths themselves are similar in terms of needing to achieve an education to end up at their desired goals and using this knowledge of problem solving to get the end, however they both take different routes from that point, to a more information technology focused route from a financial focused route. 

 

 

Plans and Progress  

  

Details about what the project will do 

The project will attempt to create a proof of concept based on the design features of a search engine with a database. The database process of retrieving information is as follows: When a query is initiated, searching for occurrence of (‘Stranger Things’ as an example) as they are found, the results are then displayed on the website. This will then show the user the results and recommendations related to the initial query, along with details of the piece of media, a link to take you to the streaming platforms information page of the media and an additional link to sign up to the stream platform if you wish to view it. The project will also have a final report attached to it based on the criteria of this assignment. 

How we will get it done 

The group work for the project will be divided into four sections, Ahmed, Amy, Kai, and Nicholas (amendment; group now down to Ahmed and Nicholas), Ahmed will focus on the GitHub portion of the assignment by relaying the information of the PDF report created by Nicholas, the formation of the proof of concept artefact will be done in GitHub with the possible addition of using search engine programs which will be listed in the tools and technology section of this report.  

The group will function within Microsoft Teams and have a direct open dialogue with each other with emails and direct messaging on Microsoft teams in addition to meetings and an open document to implement any changes.  

  

Include how far development of features and outcomes have progressed 

Creation and development of features within the program, have not escaped the scope as time restraints and departure of members has led to a focused and narrow area in what could be developed, the search functionality and database creation to show the proof of concept is on track to be completed. If more time were allocated looking for multiple weeks down the track in the future and with more funding for employees in addition to the group members, additional features could have been added, unfortunately that is not the case for this current project. 

  

How the project started journey from assignment 1 to 2 to actualized in 3 

This project’s journey began with Nicholas’ original assignment 1, as an application to search out specific pieces of media and give you directions to that query raised and lead the user to the destination on a specific platform.  

In assignment 2, the project had slightly differed in terms of turning an application into a website instead, leaving it to be modified by multiple peoples input and losing some of that functionality of an application but gaining the foundation of a website instead. 

  

Assignment 3, the project has differed once again. Using a website for the basis and creating a database in which the query can be pulled from and produce recommendations of other kinds of media related to the initial query into a sign-up page to the platform.  

As stated, the journey for this project has evolved and changed over the period of twelve weeks, from a more boarder product to a more defined product the scope creep that could of appear has been trimmed back to the basics of the project. 

  

What stage we finished on refers to timeline. 

The timeline provided in the timeframe section will lay out what has occurred during the project for more information.  

  

Include dead ends (scope creep) 

As stated earlier in this report, additions to the project could have been made, however with the diminished work force anything additional was scraped before it was started on, however ideas of cross-platform, different forms of interconnectivity, additional quality assurance and a large array of recommendations could have happened if not for the limitations of the group. 

  

Product stages as a whole 

Beginning the project, the decision to continue with a modified version of Nicholas’ project idea was accepted and work then began, report writing was left to Nicholas and realizing the group work was left to Ahmed in GitHub.  

Steps that are taken to complete the project 

Conduct a suitable amount of research into the field to produce a product with commercial viability 

Define the scope of the produce and stick to the boundaries contained within said scope for the duration of the project 

Conduct a plan review and oversight to make sure it is in line with the project guidelines

Project Description 

  

Topic 

An overview of this project is to look more at the service the project is set out to create. 

The project itself is a service given to users to request information from the repository to find their destined media piece and see where it can be viewed and how to view it. Looking at the commercial value of the product, it will be designed around a commission basis from streaming platforms to give a certain percentage of sign-up fees to the owners of the project, in a way that ordering a pizza online while using other food-based websites to get your pizza other than from Dominos themselves.  

The main audience this will attract is to be focused on newer users of streaming platforms, this can include owners of other platforms that are looking to switch or have multiple, the elderly population with the extremely simplistic nature and design of the product and bargain hunters, as with a commission-based product there can be deals in the future for using this specific way to sign up to a platform. By doing this a potentially large/untapped revenue stream can be acquired. 

  

Motivation 

This project is important because it fills in a massive void in the market for streaming platforms with potentially untapped revenue sources, because it provides a functionality that is not currently available, it looks for people who are interested in a certain type of content, but not familiar with the technologies involved with that content, have a one stop shop to browse for recommendations based on their requests and give them a directory to go to and how to get there. 

The project fits in with current IT trends as it is user focused and provides a defined outcome without any additional features or tweaks needing to be done to the project. It is also cross-platform friendly, which is a very current positive trend.  

The project shows initiative about being at the forefront of commercial success with this kind of project due to a gap in the market, the project shows planning skills by laying out in detail how to get to the final product and leadership skills as project managers for the projects creation to show employers that this is feasible under our leadership.  

  

  

Landscape 

This specific field the project is entering is one with a limited scope of competitors, however to pinpoint one potential rival it would be SelectTV, however the main difference with SelectTV and our project is, with SelectTV you must purchase the streaming platforms to browse any content, compared to our project which finds the requested piece of media for you, with a guide on how to gain access to the media source, instead of already having the source. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Aims 

  

The aim of this project is to produce a proof of concept for a product which will provide a service to millions of people worldwide and to do that the product will be to create a website that with further enhancement can be made into different applications. The product itself is with a functional search engine between different media platforms (focusing on streaming platforms such as: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime) to deliver the user requested information on a certain television show and where to go to watch specified show and then provide recommendations for similar shows and upon selecting the platform it will take you to their subscription sign up page.  

  

Sub goals for this project include: 

Creating a database; a database is a storage system where a repository of information is stored and received from to find a specific piece of media and give the relevant recommendations followed by links to correlating websites. The reason a database is needed is that this is the only storage tool capable of handling the information easily.  

  

Accessibility/Usability; Having multiple forms of access to the product as a user would create a perfect world usage, while I do not believe this project will have the resources and time to produce such a result, having it as a goal is as it is saying a goal and can contribute to scope creep from a base perspective but looking at a bigger picture situation, accessibility for users is paramount to a successful product of any kind.  

  

Cross-platform; While the project is focused on a webpage, potential expansion into cross-platform territory such as phone applications, kindles, audio book search features, the interconnectivity is endless and can go on any platform if it has access to the internet. Again, another overreach goal of the product for future times however keen minds always focuses on the potential of a product and goals it needs to have for commercial success. 

 

 

Roles  

  

Defined roles of the team. 

  

Nicholas – Project Manager: Laying out the groundwork for the project through specific planning stages, executing and controlling the project to close it out successfully. Specifying what is required to create the product and detailing the process for the other members from start to finish. Skills to be used from monitoring and controlling the projects works, developing the team itself, keeping the project in line with the scope and not allow any scope creep to occur, responsible for time management of the group and quality assurance of the product.  

  

Ahmed – Lead Developer: Implementing what the project manager has laid out and what is required to reach the final product, this job position puts Ahmed at the forefront of the project to keep it on trajectory for a satisfactory result. Types of duties throughout this process can include building and the configuration of the product, ensuring the team keeps the project to quality standards, troubleshooting, debugging, and making sure the project stays on track. 

 

Scope and Limits 

  

The true scope of focus for this project is to produce a directory search function on a website, which will look at a repository of different media databases from streaming platforms to deliver the requested response to the user with an assortment of recommendations in addition to the actual query. For example: Typing in the word ‘Stranger Things’ the search engine will retrieve your query and display a result of ‘Can be found on Netflix,’ shows you may also like (in similarity to the original query) ‘Silverpoint’ can be accessed from Hulu.  

  

Features that will not be produced in this project, the technology that concerns actual search functions, as we are just focused on the actual searching through programming and not creating a search engine from the ground up, for example: this project will not be using crawlers, spiders, or bots to scour the internet for additional content. 

  

The project will not include additional links to various sources such as signing up to a specific streaming platform to view the specified media query.  

  

The project will also not include pure indexation even though it can be considered very usual to store and categories content on a page with keywords, a ranking system is what this project will focus on, not indexing. 

 

Tools and Technologies  

The creation of this project will involve various tools and technologies. Those present in this project will be listed below into categories of Tools, Software, Hardware  

  

Tools 

This project requires the usage of a database platform being ‘MySQL 8.0.30’  

Programming languages such as C++ and Java 

GitHub (Technically a software web application, but as the hosting source it will be classed as a tool) 

 

Hardware 

Computers 

Telephones 

Router 

Modem  

Servers/hosting company to provide a place with a single network (This will be for the final completed project if funding is secured to continue) 

Keyboard 

Mouse 

 

Software 

Elastic 8.3, as a basis to create the search engine using cloud technologies (Will not be shown in the assignment portion of the project, but further down the life cycle of the project) 

Google Chrome 

 

Testing 

  

The testing plan for this project will be undertaken in a two-phase process. 

  

Phase one 

Will involve a test environment for the product, within this test environment all changes are to be undertaken, this includes and is not limited to interconnectivity, accessibility, device, and user testing all taking place in the test environment.  

User testing will involve members close to the team to be able to test the product and provide feedback based on how it is able to perform and if the desired results were achieved. 

  

Phase two 

The testing plan is to create a production environment which replicates the tested test environment. When changes are made in the future, they are safely made within the test environment and when they pass the quality assurance from the lead developer and project manager then they can be transferred over to the new production environment and be assessed for the final product.    

 

 

Timeframe 

The timeframe shown below states the functionality of the group to the plan. However, after changing the positions and the group itself being diminished in capacity all tasks will be undertaken by Nicholas and Ahmed. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Risks  

  

Risks come in all kinds of factors for projects of any type of the particular risk factors for 	this project are outlined below 

  

Copyright claims from the stream platform services for us using their databases of media for requests from users, can lead to potential copyright infringement claims.  

Piracy: Somewhat like the copyright claims, it is a specified form of stealing for making unlawful copies of copyrighted products without authorisation.  

Poor legal documentation: possibility of poor legal documentation being submitted to follow policies and laws throughout the world, lots of legal hurdles to pass through. 

Workplace culture:  

Scope Creep: Risk of scope creep incorporating and taking on more than the project can successfully deliver before the deadline date. 

Failure to deliver: Same with scope creep, being unable to produce the final product in the time given.  

Time management: Key to getting the project done is suitable time management skills however with the diminished workforce, this is a struggle to comply with.  

Monetary affordability of continuation: Money makes the world function, and the project is no different in that regard without sufficient funds to employ the team/future employees’ completion is limited in scope.  

 

 

 

 

Group processes and communications 

The current contact methods between group members have been through the RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) group channel to acquire members, student email addresses and set up a Microsoft Teams group to discuss the project with. 

Having a series of regular meetings and constantly typing out direct messages between group members throughout the project. 

When direct messaging does not receive an answer, sending an email correspondence from the RMIT information given is the only other way the group can contact each other, or messages from the tutorial instructor to pass on to them as well.  

Current group contact has been constant from direct messaging every two days, ramping up towards the end of the project and meetings once a week to outline what each member has done, according to the plan and discussing further work needs.

Experience from the team 

Nicholas – I have had zero experience outside of this course in using the tools listed and software for the creation of this project. 

Ahmed – I have some experience as in my previous years I have built a website and done database work before, but I am still not at that high of a level 

 

 

 

 

 

Group Reflection  

  

Nicholas – Reflecting on the group's performance this time around is different, we first started assignment 2 with 6 members, it was diminished to 4 members and the participation factor with those members was zero or very minimal. In assignment 3, Ahmed and myself were very communicative at the start and while waiting for Kai and Amy to respond, we find out Kai has left the group and Amy is still missing in action. To say this project has been a success would be extremely far from the truth compared to the knowledge learnt during the course and the standard required to get a good result. We took up the roles of addressing a group leader and setting out who was to do what and where and even with this implementation, we still cannot form a functioning group and I am disappointed things could not turn out better.
