      <h1>Project Description</h1>
	  <h2>Overview:</h2>
	  <h3>Topic</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">An overview of this project is to look more at the service the project is set out to create.<br></br>The project itself is a service given to users to request information from the repository to find their destined media piece and see where it can be viewed and how to view it. Looking at the commercial value of the product, it will be designed around a commission basis from streaming platforms to give a certain percentage of sign-up fees to the owners of the project, in a way that ordering a pizza online while using other food-based websites to get your pizza other than from Dominos themselves.<br></br>The main audience this will attract is to be focused on newer users of streaming platforms, this can include owners of other platforms that are looking to switch or have multiple, the elderly population with the extremely simplistic nature and design of the product and bargain hunters, as with a commission-based product there can be deals in the future for using this specific way to sign up to a platform. By doing this a potentially large/untapped revenue stream can be acquired. </h5>

	  <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This project is important because it fills in a massive void in the market for streaming platforms with potentially untapped revenue sources, because it provides a functionality that is not currently available, it looks for people who are interested in a certain type of content, but not familiar with the technologies involved with that content, have a one stop shop to browse for recommendations based on their requests and give them a directory to go to and how to get there.<br></br>The project fits in with current IT trends as it is user focused and provides a defined outcome without any additional features or tweaks needing to be done to the project. It is also cross-platform friendly, which is a very current positive trend.<br></br>The project shows initiative about being at the forefront of commercial success with this kind of project due to a gap in the market, the project shows planning skills by laying out in detail how to get to the final product and leadership skills as project managers for the projects creation to show employers that this is feasible under our leadership.  </h5>

	  <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This specific field the project is entering is one with a limited scope of competitors, however to pinpoint one potential rival it would be SelectTV, however the main difference with SelectTV and our project is, with SelectTV you must purchase the streaming platforms to browse any content, compared to our project which finds the requested piece of media for you, with a guide on how to gain access to the media source, instead of already having the source.</h5>

	  <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
	  <h3>Aims</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The aim of this project is to produce a proof of concept for a product which will provide a service to millions of people worldwide and to do that the product will be to create a website that with further enhancement can be made into different applications. The product itself is with a functional search engine between different media platforms (focusing on streaming platforms such as: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime) to deliver the user requested information on a certain television show and where to go to watch specified show and then provide recommendations for similar shows and upon selecting the platform it will take you to their subscription sign up page.  </h5>
	  <h3>Sub goals for this project include:</h3>

	  <h4>Creating a database</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A database is a storage system where a repository of information is stored and received from to find a specific piece of media and give the relevant recommendations followed by links to correlating websites. The reason a database is needed is that this is the only storage tool capable of handling the information easily. </h5>

	  <h4>Accessibility/Usability</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> Having multiple forms of access to the product as a user would create a perfect world usage, while I do not believe this project will have the resources and time to produce such a result, having it as a goal is as it is saying a goal and can contribute to scope creep from a base perspective but looking at a bigger picture situation, accessibility for users is paramount to a successful product of any kind. </h5>

	  <h4>Cross-platform</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">While the project is focused on a webpage, potential expansion into cross-platform territory such as phone applications, kindles, audio book search features, the interconnectivity is endless and can go on any platform if it has access to the internet. Again, another overreach goal of the product for future times however keen minds always focuses on the potential of a product and goals it needs to have for commercial success.</h5>
