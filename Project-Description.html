      <h1>Project Description</h1>
	  <h2>Overview:</h2>
	  <h3>Topic</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">An overview of this project is to look more at the service the project is set out to create.<br></br>The project itself is a service given to users to request information from the repository to find their destined media piece and see where it can be viewed and how to view it. Looking at the commercial value of the product, it will be designed around a commission basis from streaming platforms to give a certain percentage of sign-up fees to the owners of the project, in a way that ordering a pizza online while using other food-based websites to get your pizza other than from Dominos themselves.<br></br>The main audience this will attract is to be focused on newer users of streaming platforms, this can include owners of other platforms that are looking to switch or have multiple, the elderly population with the extremely simplistic nature and design of the product and bargain hunters, as with a commission-based product there can be deals in the future for using this specific way to sign up to a platform. By doing this a potentially large/untapped revenue stream can be acquired. </h5>

	  <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This project is important because it fills in a massive void in the market for streaming platforms with potentially untapped revenue sources, because it provides a functionality that is not currently available, it looks for people who are interested in a certain type of content, but not familiar with the technologies involved with that content, have a one stop shop to browse for recommendations based on their requests and give them a directory to go to and how to get there.<br></br>The project fits in with current IT trends as it is user focused and provides a defined outcome without any additional features or tweaks needing to be done to the project. It is also cross-platform friendly, which is a very current positive trend.<br></br>The project shows initiative about being at the forefront of commercial success with this kind of project due to a gap in the market, the project shows planning skills by laying out in detail how to get to the final product and leadership skills as project managers for the projects creation to show employers that this is feasible under our leadership.  </h5>

	  <h3>Landscape</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This specific field the project is entering is one with a limited scope of competitors, however to pinpoint one potential rival it would be SelectTV, however the main difference with SelectTV and our project is, with SelectTV you must purchase the streaming platforms to browse any content, compared to our project which finds the requested piece of media for you, with a guide on how to gain access to the media source, instead of already having the source.</h5>

	  <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
	  <h3>Aims</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The aim of this project is to produce a proof of concept for a product which will provide a service to millions of people worldwide and to do that the product will be to create a website that with further enhancement can be made into different applications. The product itself is with a functional search engine between different media platforms (focusing on streaming platforms such as: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime) to deliver the user requested information on a certain television show and where to go to watch specified show and then provide recommendations for similar shows and upon selecting the platform it will take you to their subscription sign up page.  </h5>
	  <h3>Sub goals for this project include:</h3>

	  <h4>Creating a database</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A database is a storage system where a repository of information is stored and received from to find a specific piece of media and give the relevant recommendations followed by links to correlating websites. The reason a database is needed is that this is the only storage tool capable of handling the information easily. </h5>

	  <h4>Accessibility/Usability</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32"> Having multiple forms of access to the product as a user would create a perfect world usage, while I do not believe this project will have the resources and time to produce such a result, having it as a goal is as it is saying a goal and can contribute to scope creep from a base perspective but looking at a bigger picture situation, accessibility for users is paramount to a successful product of any kind. </h5>

	  <h4>Cross-platform</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">While the project is focused on a webpage, potential expansion into cross-platform territory such as phone applications, kindles, audio book search features, the interconnectivity is endless and can go on any platform if it has access to the internet. Again, another overreach goal of the product for future times however keen minds always focuses on the potential of a product and goals it needs to have for commercial success.</h5>

	  <h3>Roles</h3>
	  <h4>Nicholas:</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Project Manager: Laying out the groundwork for the project through specific planning stages, executing and controlling the project to close it out successfully. Specifying what is required to create the product and detailing the process for the other members from start to finish. Skills to be used from monitoring and controlling the projects works, developing the team itself, keeping the project in line with the scope and not allow any scope creep to occur, responsible for time management of the group and quality assurance of the product. </h5>

	  <h4>Ahmed:</h4>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Lead Developer: Implementing what the project manager has laid out and what is required to reach the final product, this job position puts Ahmed at the forefront of the project to keep it on trajectory for a satisfactory result. Types of duties throughout this process can include building and the configuration of the product, ensuring the team keeps the project to quality standards, troubleshooting, debugging, and making sure the project stays on track.</h5>

	<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The true scope of focus for this project is to produce a directory search function on a website, which will look at a repository of different media databases from streaming platforms to deliver the requested response to the user with an assortment of recommendations in addition to the actual query. For example: Typing in the word ‘Stranger Things’ the search engine will retrieve your query and display a result of ‘Can be found on Netflix,’ shows you may also like (in similarity to the original query) ‘Silverpoint’ can be accessed from Hulu.
	<br></br>
	Features that will not be produced in this project, the technology that concerns actual search functions, as we are just focused on the actual searching through programming and not creating a search engine from the ground up, for example: this project will not be using crawlers, spiders, or bots to scour the internet for additional content.
	<br></br>
	The project will not include additional links to various sources such as signing up to a specific streaming platform to view the specified media query.
	<br></br>
	The project will also not include pure indexation even though it can be considered very usual to store and categories content on a page with keywords, a ranking system is what this project will focus on, not indexing. </h5>

	<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The creation of this project will involve various tools and technologies. Those present in this project will be listed below into categories of Tools, Software and Hardware.</h5>

	<h4>Tools</h4>
	  <ul>
		<li>This project requires the usage of a database platform being ‘MySQL 8.0.30’  </li>
		<li>Programming languages such as C++ and Java </li>
		<li>GitHub (Technically a software web application, but as the hosting source it will be classed as a tool)</li>
      </ul>

	<h4>Hardware</h4>
	  <ul>
		<li>Computers</li>
		<li>Telephones </li>
		<li>Router </li>
		<li>Modem</li>
		<li>Servers/hosting company to provide a place with a single network (This will be for the final completed project if funding is secured to continue)  </li>
		<li>Keyboard </li>
		<li>Mouse</li>
      </ul>

	<h4>Software</h4>
	  <ul>
		<li>Elastic 8.3, as a basis to create the search engine using cloud technologies (Will not be shown in the assignment portion of the project, but further down the life cycle of the project) </li>
		<li>Google Chrome </li>
      </ul>


	<h3>Testing</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The testing plan for this project will be undertaken in a two-phase process.</h5>

	<h4>Phase One</h4>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Will involve a test environment for the product, within this test environment all changes are to be undertaken, this includes and is not limited to interconnectivity, accessibility, device, and user testing all taking place in the test environment.<br></br>User testing will involve members close to the team to be able to test the product and provide feedback based on how it is able to perform and if the desired results were achieved. </h5>

	<h4>Phase Two</h4>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The testing plan is to create a production environment which replicates the tested test environment. When changes are made in the future, they are safely made within the test environment and when they pass the quality assurance from the lead developer and project manager then they can be transferred over to the new production environment and be assessed for the final product.     </h5>

	<h3>Timeframe</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The timeframe shown below states the functionality of the group to the plan. However, after changing the positions and the group itself being diminished in capacity all tasks will be undertaken by Nicholas and Ahmed.</h5>
	<img src="Picture1.png" alt="TimeTable" />

	<h3>Risks</h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Risks come in all kinds of factors for projects of any type of the particular risk factors for this project are outlined below </h5>

	  <ul>
		<li>Copyright claims from the stream platform services for us using their databases of media for requests from users, can lead to potential copyright infringement claims.  </li>
		<li>Piracy: Somewhat like the copyright claims, it is a specified form of stealing for making unlawful copies of copyrighted products without authorisation.   </li>
		<li>Poor legal documentation: possibility of poor legal documentation being submitted to follow policies and laws throughout the world, lots of legal hurdles to pass through.  </li>
		<li>Scope Creep: Risk of scope creep incorporating and taking on more than the project can successfully deliver before the deadline date. </li>
		<li>Servers/hosting company to provide a place with a single network (This will be for the final completed project if funding is secured to continue)  </li>
		<li>Failure to deliver: Same with scope creep, being unable to produce the final product in the time given.   </li>
		<li>Time management: Key to getting the project done is suitable time management skills however with the diminished workforce, this is a struggle to comply with.  </li>
		<li>Monetary affordability of continuation: Money makes the world function, and the project is no different in that regard without sufficient funds to employ the team/future employees’ completion is limited in scope.  </li>
      </ul>
	<br></br>
	<h3>Group processes and communications </h3>
	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">The current contact methods between group members have been through the RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) group channel to acquire members, student email addresses and set up a Microsoft Teams group to discuss the project with.
	<br></br>
	Having a series of regular meetings and constantly typing out direct messages between group members throughout the project.
	<br></br>
	When direct messaging does not receive an answer, sending an email correspondence from the RMIT information given is the only other way the group can contact each other, or messages from the tutorial instructor to pass on to them as well.
	<br></br>
	Current group contact has been constant from direct messaging every two days, ramping up towards the end of the project and meetings once a week to outline what each member has done, according to the plan and discussing further work needs. </h5>
